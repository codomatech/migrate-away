# A Practical Guide to Hosting Your Next.js App

This guide walks you through different ways to get your Next.js application online. The goal is to help you choose a hosting strategy that balances performance, flexibility, and cost, without being locked in with a single provider.

To host your app, you need to manage:

- Application Hosting
- DNS
- CDN

## Application Hosting

Below are three common hosting strategies. Each section is collapsible—simply click on the option name to see its full details.

You can adapt the provided [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) file to fit the needs of the options described below.

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1: Hosting on a single server</b></summary>

This is the simplest approach, where everything your app needs (the website, database, and content management system) runs on a single machine.

### What This Includes

*   **A Next.js App**: You can use the provided example app (based on a feature-rich [boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate)) or replace it with your own.
*   **A Database**: Choose between PostgreSQL or MySQL.
*   **Payload CMS**: A system for managing your website's content.

### How to Set It Up

1.  **Get a Server**: Rent a cloud server with SSH access. Look for one with at least **4GB of RAM** and **2 CPU cores**. Providers like Hetzner or Contabo are good examples.
2.  **Connect and Install**: Log into your server via SSH and install Docker by following the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3.  **Copy Project Files**: Clone this project's repository to your server.
4.  **Configure**: Edit the `compose/allservices.compose.yml` file to match your needs (e.g., select your preferred database).
5.  **Deploy**: Run `docker compose build` to build your app, then `docker compose up -d` to start all services.

### Summary

*   **Advantages**: Simple to understand and set up; generally the lowest cost.
*   **Disadvantages**: Cannot easily handle very large amounts of traffic; Your app is shortly down when you update the code. You must manually back up your database.
*   **Best For**: Websites with low to moderate traffic (e.g., under 10,000 visits per month).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Partially Managed Hosting</b></b></summary>

This approach adds scalability by moving some components to managed cloud services, reducing your maintenance workload.

### What This Includes

You separate your services:
*   The **Database** is moved to a managed cloud service (e.g., a platform like Prisma Data Platform).
*   Optionally, the **Next.js app** and **Payload CMS** are hosted on your own servers.

### How to Set It Up

The setup is similar to Option 1, but with a key difference:
1.  **Use a Managed Database**: Sign up for a cloud database service (e.g. prisma.io). You will get a connection string (a web address) for your database.
2.  **Update Configuration**: In your app and CMS configuration, replace the local database connection details with the new connection string from your managed provider.
3.  **Deploy App and CMS**: Follow the deployment steps from Option 1, but your app will now connect to the external database.

### Summary

*   **Advantages**: More scalable than a single server; your database is automatically backed up and managed by the provider.
*   **Disadvantages**: The app and CMS servers themselves are still not highly scalable. Higher cost than Option 1 due to managed service fees.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 3: Fully Managed Hosting</b></summary>

This modern approach aims for maximum scalability by hosting all components—the app, CMS, and database—on "serverless" or managed platforms.

### What This Includes

*   **Managed Database**: A cloud database service (e.g., Prisma Data Platform).
*   **Serverless Hosting**: Platforms like Replit, Runpod, Azure Functions to host your Next.js app and Payload CMS. These platforms automatically adjust capacity based on traffic.

### How to Set It Up

This process varies by platform but generally involves:
1.  **Host Your Database**: Set up your database with a managed provider.
2.  **Connect Your Code**: Link your project repository directly to the serverless hosting provider.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: In your hosting provider's dashboard, provide the connection string for your managed database and any other required settings.
4.  **Deploy**: The provider will automatically build and deploy your app. Updates are often triggered by simply pushing changes to your code repository.

### Summary

*   **Advantages**: Highly scalable; you only pay for the resources you use; no server management is required.
*   **Disadvantages**: Can involve multiple services and subscriptions; may require more complex configuration.
